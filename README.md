# Engineering-Stats-Project-MTH2302D
The project involved analyzing a dataset of vehicle attributes using statistical methods learned in the MTH2302D course. The analysis included producing correlation matrices, histograms, box plots, normal probability plots, and tests of normality. Results were interpreted for each variable.

The project involved conducting a descriptive statistical analysis and inference on a dataset with three quantitative variables. The three variables were fuel efficiency, engine displacement, and vehicle weight. The project started with examining the links between the three variables by producing a matrix of correlations and interpreting the results. Next, for each variable, the project produced histograms, Tukey diagrams, normal probability plots, and tests of normality to analyze the distribution of the data. Finally, the project computed summary statistics, including the mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and interquartile range, and interpreted the results. The project used R programming language and several packages such as dplyr, knitr, ggplot2, and gtsummary to perform the statistical analysis and produce the visualizations. Overall, the project aimed to provide insights into the relationships between the variables and help draw conclusions about the dataset.
